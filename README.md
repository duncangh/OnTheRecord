# OnTheRecord
Keep track of the record of public officials over time

# Short Term Goals:

  1. Match the extracted quotes to the person who said it. 
  2. Create TimeSeries profiles of individuals and their records over time. 
  3. Add other firsthand sources, such as official statements from gov't offices, Twitter (sigh), as well as voting history on legislation & other assorted data on job related activity.
