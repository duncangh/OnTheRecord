# OnTheRecord
Keep track of the record of public officials over time

# Short Term Goals:

  1. Match the extracted quotes to the person who said it. 
  2. Create TimeSeries profiles of individuals and their records over time. 
  3. Add other firsthand sources, such as official statements from gov't offices, Twitter (sigh), as well as voting history on legislation & other assorted data on job related activity.

# Long Term Goal: Implement a robust Object Oriented Fact Library
  1. Build an Organizational Framework That:
    i.  Monitors The Official Channels for Statements and Releases
    ii. Maintains A Current Network of Critical Agents and Their Own Statement History
      
    iii. Aggregates Pertinent Documents and Primary Sources. 
    iv.  Links Documents to Related Parties. E.g. Maps all historical rulings to a Surpreme Court Judge.
